Hold tight, folks! 

Work is in full swing on my latest project: a **Single Page Application with React**! 

Our aim? To let you easily select check-in and check-out dates and book your dream room, all while indulging in some spa treatments and keeping track of your order summary.
Next up, we're creating a user account and authentication system, so you can access all the goodies with ease. 

And what's powering our tech wizardry? A hefty dose of **React, React Router, and Redux**, plus a sprinkle of **Lodash, Date-fns, and Vite**. So sit back, relax, and let us take your booking experience up a notch!
